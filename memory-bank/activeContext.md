# Active Context

## Current Focus Areas
1. **Process Version Management UI**
   - Version activation workflow
   - Status indicators in ProcessVersionDialog
2. **OAuth2 Security Integration**
   - Scope verification for process APIs
   - Role-based access control

## Recent Changes
1. Added ProcessVersionDialog component
2. Implemented version activation/deactivation endpoints
3. Integrated Flowable deployment status tracking
4. Added OAuth2 scope requirements to process controllers
5. Added SLF4J logging to FormServiceImpl for key operations

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete ProcessVersionDialog UI enhancements
2. Implement version comparison functionality
3. Add OAuth2 scope verification middleware
4. Write integration tests for version management

## Blockers & Risks
1. Flowable deployment timeout needs optimization
2. OAuth2 token refresh not yet implemented
3. Test coverage below target for critical paths

## Priority Order
1. Process version UI completion
2. OAuth2 security integration
3. Performance optimizations
4. Test coverage improvement
